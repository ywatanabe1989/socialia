Python/matplotlib prototype — feedback welcome.

## Assets
- [x] Main image: `../assets/FigRecipe-demo.png`
- [ ] **Priority**: GIF showing edit → export code flow

## Lessons Applied (from r/visualization assessment)

| Lesson | Applied |
|--------|---------|
| Lead with output, not tool | Title shows result: "click to edit, code to reproduce" |
| Shorter text | 2 lines + link (was 8 lines) |
| Let images speak | Minimal explanation |
| Engage first | Pre-post checklist added |

## Pre-Post Checklist
- [ ] Comment helpfully on 2-3 r/datavisualization posts
- [ ] Wait 1-2 days after engaging
- [ ] Create GIF showing edit → code export
- [ ] Post during US peak hours (9-11am EST)

## Notes
- More technical than r/dataisbeautiful — "reproduce" and "code" resonate
- Still keep text minimal
- GIF should show the reproducibility angle (edit → get code)
