## Title

Exploring reproducible scientific figures as structured, editable objects

## Body

I'm experimenting with a new way to think about scientific figures — not as static images, but as structured, editable objects.

The idea is to make figures:
- reproducible
- programmatically editable
- easier to revise and reuse during research

This is an early prototype built around Python/matplotlib, with a small GUI for interactive editing.

I'm curious what people here think:
- Does this abstraction make sense?
- What parts of figure creation are most painful in your workflow?

Feedback welcome — especially critical ones.
