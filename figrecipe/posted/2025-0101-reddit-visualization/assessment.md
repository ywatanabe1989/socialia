- Top Countries: US 48.1%, AU 10.5%, UK 8.6%

## Analysis

### What's Normal
- 324 views in 2hrs is decent reach for r/visualization
- First-time project posts often get mixed reception
- Technical subreddits are skeptical of self-promotion

### What 66.7% Ratio Suggests
- Roughly 2:1 up/down ratio - some users perceive it as promo
- No organic engagement beyond views
- Lurkers viewed but didn't engage

### Possible Factors
- Post reads as tool promotion rather than visualization showcase
- Text-heavy explanation vs. letting visuals speak
- New account / first post in subreddit

## Lessons for Future Posts

1. **Lead with output, not the tool** - Show a striking figure first
2. **r/dataisbeautiful** - Prefers visual impact over technical explanation
3. **Before/after comparison** - Demonstrates value more clearly
4. **Stagger timing** - Wait days between subreddit posts
5. **Engage first** - Comment on others' posts before self-promoting
6. **Shorter text** - Let the demo image do the talking
