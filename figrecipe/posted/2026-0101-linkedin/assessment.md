# Assessment: 2026-0101 LinkedIn Post

## Performance Summary
- **Impressions**: 63
- **Post impressions**: 108
- **Profile viewers**: 17
- **Reactions**: 1
- **Engagement rate**: ~1.6% (1/63)

## What Worked
- New Year timing creates natural engagement opportunity
- Bilingual format (EN/JP) reaches broader audience
- Personal narrative ("overseas research fellow") adds authenticity
- Clear project description with concrete components (Scholar, Vis, Code, Writer)
- Including scitex.ai URL provides easy access point

## What Could Improve
- Low reaction count (1) suggests content may be too long/text-heavy
- Consider adding visual demo or screenshot of SciTeX in action
- The post is informational but lacks clear call-to-action
- Could benefit from tagging relevant connections or using hashtags

## Lessons Learned
1. LinkedIn algorithm favors shorter posts with images
2. New Year posts compete with many similar greetings
3. Technical project announcements need visual hooks
4. Consider posting at peak engagement times (weekday mornings)

## Action Items for Next Post
- [ ] Include demo image or GIF showing SciTeX workflow
- [ ] Shorter text, more visual content
- [ ] Add specific call-to-action (star repo, try demo, etc.)
- [ ] Use relevant hashtags (#OpenScience #ResearchTools #LaTeX)
- [ ] Post during weekday business hours for better reach
