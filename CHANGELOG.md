## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.11]

### Changed

- **No-mocks + test-quality migration** (PR #33). The entire `tests/` tree
  is rewritten to exercise real collaborators — `unittest.mock`,
  `pytest-mock`, and `monkeypatch` are gone (PA-306 audit: 0). Every test
  now satisfies the SciTeX test-quality contract (PA-307 audit: 0):
  AAA marker comments, descriptive `>= 3`-word name, and exactly one
  assertion. Net suite: 252 passed / 3 skipped under both deterministic
  and `pytest-randomly` random orderings.
- `Twitter`, `LinkedIn`, and `GoogleAnalytics` accept new keyword-only
  collaborator hooks (`session_factory=`, `http=`) so consumers can
  inject a fake or alternative HTTP client without monkey-patching.
  Defaults preserve the previous module-level behaviour.
- `scheduler.schedule_post` / `list_scheduled` / `cancel_scheduled` /
  `run_due_jobs` accept `schedule_file=` so callers can point the
  job store at a `tmp_path` (or any other location) without mutating
  module globals.

### Fixed

- CI: `[dev]` extras now include `pytest-cov` and `pytest-randomly`, so
  the `pytest --cov=src/socialia --cov-report=xml` invocation in
  `pytest-matrix-on-ubuntu-py3-11-3-12-3-13.yml` resolves cleanly.
- Docs: `sphinx-build -W` is now warning-clean (was: 109 warnings →
  errors on every PR build). Three root causes addressed —
  `GoogleAnalytics` docstring `SOCIALIA_:` token (parsed as RST
  hyperlink), `track_event` example block (Napoleon definition-list
  parsing), and `automodule::` + per-class `autoclass::` collision in
  `docs/sphinx/api/socialia.rst`.

## [0.5.9]

- Initial CHANGELOG entry — see git log for prior history.
