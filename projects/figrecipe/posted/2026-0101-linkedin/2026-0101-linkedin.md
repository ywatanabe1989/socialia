## Body

Dear all,

Happy New Year.

Over the past year, while working as an overseas research fellow, I made a deliberate decision to focus on building infrastructure that supports efficiency, reproducibility, and verifiability in scientific research.

In particular, I have been developing an open-source ecosystem called SciTeX (short for Science × LaTeX). It aims to support the full research workflow — including literature management (Scholar), figure creation (Vis), analysis (Code), and manuscript writing (Writer). Development is ongoing, but the foundation is gradually taking shape (https://scitex.ai).

Although the project is still evolving, I hope to grow it into software that provides genuine value to the research community.

Thank you very much for your continued support, and I wish you all a productive and fulfilling year ahead.

Sincerely,
Yusuke Watanabe
