## Performance Timeline

| Time | Views | Upvotes | Ratio | Rank |
|------|-------|---------|-------|------|
| 1hr | 259 | - | 67% | - |

## What Worked

1. **1K+ views in 24hrs** - Excellent organic reach for first post
2. **Reached #1** - Algorithm favored the post despite low engagement
3. **Global audience** - 46% "Other" shows international interest
4. **Title worked** - "Exploring reproducible scientific figures" attracted clicks
5. **Sustained traffic** - Views kept growing even after 24hrs

## What Didn't Work

1. **Low engagement rate** - 0.1% (1 upvote / 1,000 views)
2. **No organic comments** - Only self-comment, no community discussion
3. **Got downvoted** - 75% → 60% ratio overnight
4. **Text-heavy** - Post explained too much, didn't let visuals speak
5. **Perceived as self-promo** - Technical subreddits are skeptical

## Why High Views but Low Engagement?

- **Curiosity gap**: Title made people click, but content didn't convert
- **No "wow" moment**: Missing striking visual that stops scrollers
- **Tool description vs showcase**: Explained what it does, not why it matters
- **New account**: No established credibility in the community
- **Niche topic**: Reproducible figures appeals to few but interests many

## Lessons Learned

### For r/dataisbeautiful (next post)
- [ ] Lead with stunning output image, not tool description
- [ ] Use relatable hook: "I got tired of remaking figures..."
- [ ] Shorter text - 2-3 sentences max
- [ ] Include before/after comparison
- [ ] Post during US peak hours (9am-12pm EST)

### For r/Python (planned)
- [ ] Focus on code/technical angle
- [ ] Show matplotlib integration
- [ ] "Treating figures as data structures" hook
- [ ] Include code snippet in post

### General
- [ ] Engage in community before self-promoting
- [ ] Stagger posts by 2-3 days minimum
- [ ] 80%+ upvote ratio should be the target
- [ ] Track GitHub stars/traffic alongside Reddit metrics

## Score

| Aspect | Rating | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Reach | **9/10** | 1K+ views, #1 rank - exceptional |
| Engagement | 2/10 | No comments, 1 upvote, 60% ratio |
| Conversion | 2/10 | Views didn't translate to action |
| Learning | 9/10 | Clear insights for next post |
| **Overall** | **5.5/10** | Great reach, poor conversion |

## Key Takeaway

**1,000+ views proves the concept has interest.** The problem isn't visibility - it's conversion. Next post should focus on emotional hook + visual impact rather than technical explanation.
