# Reddit Post Draft: FigRecipe MCP Server

## Meta
- **Platform**: r/mcp (primary), r/Python (secondary)
- **Draft date**: 2026-01-16
- **Topic**: MCP server for AI-powered figure creation
- **Type**: Show HN style - technical, honest

## Title

[Promo] figrecipe - MCP server for reproducible matplotlib figures

## Body

figrecipe saves matplotlib figures as structured YAML recipes — reproducible, editable, and validatable.

v0.14.0 introduces an MCP server, enabling any MCP-compatible agent to generate publication-ready figures programmatically. A built-in GUI editor allows human refinement when needed.

```bash
pip install figrecipe
figrecipe mcp install  # adds to Claude Code config
```

Feedback on the MCP tool design is appreciated. My focus is on automated scientific research workflows.

## Subreddit Options

| Subreddit | Fit | Notes |
|-----------|-----|-------|
| r/mcp | Best | Exact target audience, MCP enthusiasts |
| r/Python | High | Core audience, technical depth OK |
| r/MachineLearning | Medium | AI angle, but more research-focused |
| r/datascience | Medium | Practical workflow angle |

## Notes
- Previous r/visualization post: 1K views, low engagement (0.1%)
- This time: more technical depth, code examples
- MCP is niche but growing - early adopters are vocal
- Ask specific question at end to drive comments
- Consider crossposting after 24hrs if r/Python does well
