## Content

**A database for automated research agents.**

Major academic databases lack what AI scientists need most: abstracts, impact factors, and citation graphs. They also impose strict rate limits.

To address these challenges, I developed crossref-local — a fully open-source Python package built on CrossRef open data.

- 167M scholarly works
- Full abstracts
- Impact factors
- Citation graphs
- Local
- Instant
- No limits

```bash
$ crossref-local search "CRISPR" -n 1 -a

# Found 87,473 matches in 18.2ms
# 1. RS-1 enhances CRISPR/Cas9- and TALEN-mediated knock-in efficiency (2016)
#    DOI: 10.1038/ncomms10548
#    Journal: Nature Communications
#    Abstract: Zinc-finger nuclease, transcription activator-like effector nuclease
#    and CRISPR/Cas9 are becoming major tools for genome editing...
```

Feedback and contributions are welcome.
