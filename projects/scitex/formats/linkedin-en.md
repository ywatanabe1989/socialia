[WHY]   1-2 lines - Relatable insight everyone agrees with
        ↓
[PAIN]  2-3 lines - Daily frustration, personal angle
        ↓
[HOW]   1 paragraph - "So I built..." natural transition
        ↓
[CODE]  8-12 lines with comments
        ↓
[FEATURES]  Inline list with "etc." or short bullets
        ↓
[CTA]   Soft - "feedback welcome"
        ↓
[HASHTAGS]  3-4 relevant tags
```

## Template

```
[Universal insight - how things work elsewhere]

[Pain point - why current situation is frustrating. Personal: "I got tired of..."]

So I built **scitex[module]** - [one-line description].

\`\`\`python
from scitex.xxx import yyy

# Example with comments
\`\`\`

[Feature summary: X / Y / Z, etc.]

pip install scitex[module]

Built for my own workflow. If this scratches a similar itch, feedback welcome.

```

## Constraints

- First 2-3 lines determine scroll behavior
- "etc." reduces list fatigue
- Personal framing > generic
- No hard sell
