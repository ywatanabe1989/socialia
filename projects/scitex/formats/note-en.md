## Why I Built This

[Universal insight]
Example: On Mac/Windows, double-click opens the right app.

[Pain point]
Example: In research, we handle many formats daily. CSV, JSON, NPY, PTH... each with different APIs.

[Motivation]
Example: I wanted that same "click and it works" feel in code.

## Usage

\`\`\`python
from scitex.xxx import yyy

# Example with comments
\`\`\`

## Supported Formats

- Category: item, item, item

## Install

\`\`\`bash
pip install scitex[module]
\`\`\`

## Closing

Built for my own research workflow.
If you've felt the same frustration, feedback welcome.
