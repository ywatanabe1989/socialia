# Reddit Post Format (English)

## Structure

```
TITLE:  [module] - [what it does, factual, no hype]

[WHY]   Observation that makes people nod
        ↓
[PAIN]  Personal experience, honest frustration
        ↓
[HOW]   "So I built..." or "So I packaged..."
        ↓
[CODE]  10-15 lines OK, comprehensive
        ↓
[FEATURES]  Bullet lists welcome, technical depth OK
        ↓
[CTA]   "Feedback welcome - especially [specific thing]"
```

## Template

```
**Title:** scitex[module] - [factual description]

[Universal observation - how things work in other contexts]

[Personal pain - "I work with X daily. Each has its own API."]

Then I realized: [the insight]. Why doesn't [domain] have that?

So I packaged my wrappers:

\`\`\`python
from scitex.xxx import yyy

# Comprehensive example
\`\`\`

**Supported:**
- Category: item, item, item

**Features:**
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

\`\`\`bash
pip install scitex[module]
\`\`\`

Part of a larger personal toolkit, but fully usable standalone. Feedback welcome - especially [specific request].
```

## Constraints

- Title: No hype, factual
