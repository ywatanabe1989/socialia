## Title

Organizing my research Python code for others - where to start?

## Body

I've been building a Python library for my own research work (plotting, stats, reproducibility tracking) and decided to open-source it.

The main idea: wrap common research tasks so scripts are shorter and outputs are automatically organized. For example, figures auto-export their underlying data as CSV, and experiment runs get tracked in timestamped folders.

Before I put more effort into documentation/packaging, I'm wondering:

1. Is this the kind of thing others might actually use, or too niche?
2. What would make you consider trying a new research workflow tool?
3. Any obvious gaps from glancing at the repo?

Happy to hear "this already exists, use X instead" - genuinely trying to figure out if this is worth pursuing beyond my own use.

## Notes

- Keep tone conversational and humble
- Invites genuine feedback, not just promotion
- Short enough to respect readers' time
- Questions give people something concrete to respond to
