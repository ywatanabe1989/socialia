## English

I built a system where an AI agent autonomously conducts research—from literature search to peer-reviewed manuscript.

40 minutes. Almost zero human intervention. Just setup "scitex MCP server."

The demo: A sleep-cognition study (3×3 factorial, N=180)
- Define theme
- Search local CrossRef database with abstracts
- Analyzed demo data
- Ran statistical analysis (ANOVA, post-hoc tests)
- Created 4 high-quality figures
- Wrote a 21-page manuscript with proper citations
- Simulated peer review and drafted revision responses

Future goal: automated verification of scientific integrity at each pipeline stage—from raw data to final manuscript. Less burden on reviewers, more reproducible science.
