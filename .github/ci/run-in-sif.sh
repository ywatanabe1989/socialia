# WHY a layered install (not the bare PYTHONPATH=src trick scitex-dev uses):
# the shared ci-cpu.sif bakes scitex-dev[all,dev] DEPS, NOT socialia's —
# matplotlib / graphviz / seaborn / django / Pillow / networkx / playwright /
# pytesseract / scitex-app / scitex-ui are absent from the SIF. So we install
# THIS checkout + its [all,dev] extras (WITH dependency resolution) into a
# writable --target dir and prepend that on PYTHONPATH. The SIF still supplies
# the heavy shared base (pip/uv, the python interpreters, scitex-dev's deps),
# so only socialia's own thin dep set is fetched per run.
#
# --target (not a plain `-e .`): the SIF's /opt/venv-* are root-owned + RO and
# the HPC compute-node HOME is RO inside the container, so a normal site install
# fails Permission denied. A writable target on node-local /tmp sidesteps both.
#
# Fail-loud: a missing interpreter or a failed install is a hard error.

# suites are big SINGLE modules (e.g. tests/integration/test_all_plotters_*.py
# parametrize one test over all 47 plotters, ~28 s each). loadscope therefore
# ran all ~50+ cases of such a module SERIALLY on one worker (~25 min) while the
# rest idled. There are NO module/session/class-scoped fixtures in those heavy
# modules and the root conftest's autouse `_close_figures` resets pyplot state
# after EVERY test, so loadscope's "same worker per module" buys nothing here —
# it only serialized. `load` spreads the parametrized cases across ALL workers.
