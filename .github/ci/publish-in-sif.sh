# Runs INSIDE the reused scitex-ci SIF (apptainer exec — invoked via
# exec-in-sif.sh). Publishes ./dist/* to PyPI via MANUAL OIDC Trusted
# Publishing, then twine upload.
#
# WHY manual OIDC (not pypa/gh-action-pypi-publish): that action is a Docker
# container action. Self-hosted Spartan compute nodes have NO Docker, so the
# action cannot run there. PyPI Trusted Publishing is just an OIDC token
# exchange over plain HTTPS, so we do it by hand:
#
#   1. Ask the GitHub Actions OIDC provider for a JWT with audience=pypi,
#      using the per-job ACTIONS_ID_TOKEN_REQUEST_{TOKEN,URL} env vars (present
#      because the publish job declares `permissions: id-token: write`).
#      apptainer exec (no --cleanenv) passes those host env vars into the SIF.
#   2. Exchange that JWT at PyPI's mint-token endpoint for a short-lived,
#      scope-limited PyPI API token.
#   3. twine upload dist/* with TWINE_USERNAME=__token__ and that minted token.
#
# This requires a Trusted Publisher to be configured on PyPI for
# (project=socialia, owner=ywatanabe1989, repo=socialia,
#  workflow=pypi-publish-and-github-release-on-tag.yml). It already is — the
# previous releases published via the Docker action under the same trusted
# publisher; only the *client* changes here, not PyPI's trust config.
#
# curl, python and (after a --target install) twine all live in the SIF.
#
# Fail-loud (operator directive): every step asserts non-empty output and
# `set -euo pipefail`; any failure is a HARD error with the exact cause, never
# a silent skip.
