#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs INSIDE the reused scitex-ci SIF (apptainer exec — invoked via
# exec-in-sif.sh). Builds socialia's wheel + sdist into ./dist/.
#
# WHY build in the SIF: the self-hosted Spartan runner has no Python on the
# bare node (the whole reason the old `actions/setup-python@v5` step failed:
# "version 3.x not found for this OS"). The SIF bakes python 3.11/3.12/3.13 +
# pip + uv at /opt/venv-<ver>, exactly like the working pytest-matrix CI.
#
# `python -m build` needs the `build` frontend, which is NOT baked in the SIF
# (only scitex-dev[all,dev] deps are). Mirror run-in-sif.sh: install `build`
# into a writable --target on node-local /tmp and put it on PYTHONPATH. The
# SIF's /opt/venv-* are root-owned + RO and the compute-node HOME is RO inside
# the container, so a normal install fails Permission denied — a --target on
# writable scratch sidesteps both.
#
# Fail-loud (operator directive): a missing interpreter or a failed build is a
# HARD error, never a silent fallback.
