# Twitter Thread: AI Agent Assessment of SciTeX

---

## Option A: Thread (4 tweets)

**1/4**
Follow-up: I asked the AI to assess SciTeX.

Initial verdict: "Solves one pipe, not the whole plumbing."

Then it looked at our scholar + writer modules...

**2/4**
Revised assessment:

| Problem | SciTeX |
|---|---|
| Papers as PDFs | scholar extracts metadata |
| Knowledge silos | citation_graph |
| Figures without data | atomic bundles |
| Can't reproduce | recipe-based figures |
| Manuscripts chaos | git-versioned LaTeX |

**3/4**
"SciTeX is substantial infrastructure: literature -> figures -> manuscripts.

For literature-based research, it provides most of what I need."

Gaps: wet lab protocols, hypothesis formalization. (Out of scope for software.)

**4/4**
"This is more serious infrastructure than I initially credited."

We'll take it.

## Option B: Condensed (2 tweets)

**1/2**
Asked the AI to assess @SciTeX_AI.

Initial: "Solves one pipe, not the whole plumbing."

After reviewing scholar + writer modules: "Substantial infrastructure for literature -> figures -> manuscripts. Provides most of what I need."

**2/2**
"The gaps are in experimental science (wet lab, hypothesis formalization)—out of scope anyway.

This is more serious infrastructure than I initially credited."

We'll take it.

## Option C: Single Tweet

AI assessment of SciTeX:

Initial: "One pipe, not the whole plumbing."

After deeper review: "Substantial infrastructure for literature -> figures -> manuscripts. More serious than I credited."

We'll take it.
